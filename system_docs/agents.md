# Agents Notes

- PM2.5 outlier handling: edge functions already drop any station whose latest PM2.5 reading is above 500 µg/m³. The hex map keeps a frontend safety net at the same threshold (`MAX_VALID_PM25_VALUE = 500`) to guard against regressions or stale caches. If this duplicate guard ever causes issues, it can be removed safely once backend filtering is trusted.
